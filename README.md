## ML Assignment
Problem Set 01 :
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
The dataset comprises 5,863 JPEG X-Ray images and is categorised into two types (Pneumonia and Normal), organised into three folders: train, test, and val. Each folder contains subfolders for each image type.

These chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior view) were sourced from paediatric patients aged one to five years at a renowned hospital. The X-rays were part of the routine clinical care of these patients.

As a data scientist working in the healthcare industry, your task is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can classify medical images into their respective categories. The model should be able to accurately identify the type of medical image shown in an image, based on the image itself.

Problem Set 02 :
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A banking institution wants to develop a model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not based on their banking behaviour. They have collected a dataset of past customers with information about their demographics, account details, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not. The bank wants to build a model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a new customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not based on their banking behaviour.
The dataset used for this problem statement is the "Bank Marketing Data Set" which contains information on customers of a bank. The dataset includes 17 attributes such as customer demographics, account details, and whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit or not. Each customer is classified as either yes or no based on whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not.
